## Horiseaon Search Engine Optimization


This project was developed to further study and understand the basics of HTML and CSS files. It provieded starter code that needed to be cleaned up without changing what it does. It solves the problems of providing alternative text for images, adds a descriptive title to the internet tab, and the links in the header have an unique identifier. The CSS file has been reorganized so all the HTML elements selectors are at the top of the file, elements that do the same task are grouped together, class selectors are below the HTML element selectors, classes that that do the same task are grouped together, at the bottom of the CSS file is the ID selectors.
